# Digital Clock

**Designing Digital Clock on Spartan-3 xc3s400**
The main objective of the digital clock is to display the time digitally using 7-segment display on Spartan-3 FPGA Board. The digital clock by default displays the run time and time can be set by using time set assigned to switch on board. The digital clock designed is a 24-clock hour format. It displays the time in format of hours : minutes : seconds. Out of total 4MHz,it used only 1Hz frequency with 22 bit register. It uses the already existing blocks like counter.
